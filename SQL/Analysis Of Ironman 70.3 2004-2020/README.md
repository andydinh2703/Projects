# 🎯 Goals Of This Project

- Practicing asking questions given the data set, and query data to answer.
- Practicing working with data on database platform (**PostgreSQL**).
- Applying things I have learned from Datacamp into real world data set.

# 🛠 Technical Skills:

- **SQL Query Writing**: Proficient in creating complex SQL queries using JOIN, GROUP BY, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTEs, and VIEWs.
- **Data Cleaning and Type Casting**: Recognized and resolved integer division issues by casting to DECIMAL, improving data accuracy.
- **Time Formatting**: Used PostgreSQL functions like MAKE_INTERVAL and TO_CHAR to format time values for readability.
- **Data Aggregation and Analysis**: Calculated averages, percentages, and used aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT) to derive insights.
- **Performance Comparison**: Designed comparative analyses across groups (e.g., winners vs. top 10, winners vs. averages).
- **Database Design Logic**: Created modular and reusable views for better organization and querying.
- **Debugging and Validation**: Identified and fixed logic errors (e.g., transition time casting and fastest segment logic).


# 🔍 What is IRONMAN 70.3?

**IRONMAN 70.3**, also known as a **Half IRONMAN**, is a long-distance triathlon race series organized by the **World Triathlon Corporation (WTC)**. It covers **70.3 miles (113 km)** in total, which is **half the distance** of a full IRONMAN triathlon.

### **📏 Total Distance: 70.3 miles (113 km)**

- 🏊‍♂️ **Swim**: 1.2 miles (1.9 km)
- 🚴‍♂️ **Bike**: 56 miles (90 km)
- 🏃‍♂️ **Run**: 13.1 miles (21.1 km) — a half marathon

### **🔄 Race Format**

Athletes complete the swim first, followed by the bike ride, and finish with the run. There are transition areas (T1 and T2) between each discipline where athletes change gear.

### **⏱️ Time Limit**

Most IRONMAN 70.3 races have an overall time limit of **8 hours and 30 minutes**, but cutoff times are applied at each leg to ensure athlete safety.

### **🌍 Global Series**

IRONMAN 70.3 races are held **worldwide**, in locations such as:

- Oceanside, California
- Taupo, New Zealand
- St. George, Utah
- Zell am See, Austria
- Nice, France (2024 IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship)


### **🌟 Who Participates?**

- **Amateurs and professionals** alike.
- Age groupers race for personal bests or to **qualify for the IRONMAN 70.3 World Championship**.
- A great stepping stone for athletes training for a full IRONMAN (140.6 miles).


### **🏅 Why It’s Popular**

- Challenging but more manageable than the full IRONMAN.
- Often seen as the **“next level”** after sprint or Olympic-distance triathlons.
- Offers a balanced endurance test of swim, bike, and run disciplines.
